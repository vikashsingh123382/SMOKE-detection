# SMOKE-detection

detect smoke from video and to detect smoke from video we follow following steps-

1.Convert Video to frame

2.Histogram setting/ Smoke colour detection

3.Binarization of image

4. Morphological operation

We proposed an algorithm based on the concept of blob analysis to detect smoke. Here, we found that the blob analysis technique was able to detect the smoke part in the image as well as videos.
